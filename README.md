# Slim Sublime Bundle

## Description

My personal update to [tycooon's](https://github.com/tycooon/ruby-slim-tmbundle) Slim language file, which is based off of [Fred Wu's Slim bundle](http://github.com/fredwu/ruby-slim-tmbundle). 

Mostly, I wanted Slim syntax highlighting like Fred Wu's version has for HTML tag attributes. tycooon improved on Fred Wu's version, but for some reason on the Monokai theme some colors were being left off.
